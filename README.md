Introduction
============
This package provides the diazo framework implementation of the
[Amazium CSS framework](http://www.amazium.co.uk/). For documentation
on the framework itself, check the website.

This framework is used by 
[diazotheme.amazium](https://github.com/TH-code/diazotheme.amazium) 
which contains two themes that can both be used as starters for 
your own Amazium based theme.
